# Image-Processing-with-OpenCV
A Python implementation of fundamental computer vision techniques, featuring manual color space conversions (RGB to HSV/CMYK/LAB), image filtering operations (Gaussian, Median, Average), and Fourier transform processing. Built with OpenCV and NumPy, focusing on from-scratch implementations of core CV algorithms.
