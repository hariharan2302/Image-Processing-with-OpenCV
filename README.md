# Image-Processing-with-OpenCV
A Python implementation of fundamental computer vision techniques, featuring manual color space conversions (RGB to HSV/CMYK/LAB), image filtering operations (Gaussian, Median, Average), and Fourier transform processing. Built with OpenCV and NumPy, focusing on from-scratch implementations of core CV algorithms.
This project implements various image processing techniques including color space conversions, image filtering, and Fourier transform operations. It's structured as part of the CSE 573 (Computer Vision and Image Processing) coursework.

## Features

### Color Space Conversions
- RGB to HSV conversion (two different implementations)
- RGB to CMYK conversion
- RGB to LAB color space conversion

### Image Filtering Operations
- Convolution filter (3x3)
- Average filter (3x3)
- Gaussian filter (3x3)
- Median filter (5x5)
- Contrast and brightness adjustment

### Fourier Transform Operations
- Grayscale to Fourier domain conversion
- Gaussian smoothing in the Fourier domain
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV >= 4.5.4
- NumPy
